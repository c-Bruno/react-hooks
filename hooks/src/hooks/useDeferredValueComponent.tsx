/*
  ----- UseDeferredValue -----
  UseDeferredValue is a hook in React that helps you manage updates more smoothly.

  It allows you to defer changes to a value until the main tasks, like user interactions, are completed. 
  This means that if you have a value that can wait to be updated without affecting the user experience, 
  useDeferredValue will delay updating it until thereâ€™s a good time to do so, like when 
  the browser is idle. This helps keep your app responsive by not overloading it with too many updates at once.
